### Hi There, this is Jinnan

I am front-end developer who is interested in writing apps using [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (if necessary), [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/index.html), [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).

At [Esri](https://github.com/Esri), I lead the front-end development of the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/) and [Esri Maps for Public Policy](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/policy/overview/) sites, I also build cool apps to show people what can be done using ready-to-use contents on Living Atlas along with other Esri technologies, here are some less boring ones:

- [CovidPulse](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/covidpulse/)
- [Wayback](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback/)
- [Sea Ice Aware](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/sea-ice/), [Air Quality Aware](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/airquality/) and [Hurrican Aware](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/hurricane/)
- [Water Balance](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/waterbalance/)
