### Hi There, this is Jinnan

I am a front-end developer who is interested in writing apps using [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) (if necessary), [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/index.html), [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/).

At [Esri](https://github.com/Esri), I lead the front-end development of the [Living Atlas](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/en/home/) team, I also build apps to show people what can be done using ready-to-use contents on Living Atlas along with other Esri technologies.
